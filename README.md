# Optimization-and-Experimental-Design

I. INTRODUCTION

Experimental planning and optimal design are very useful tools in solving engineering problems, optimizing products, processes and systems,... according to empirical models. Today, experimental planning is applied in many fields such as economy, industry, society, .. In addition, it is also widely applied in design to replace complex analytic models with first-order polynomials. or 2nd order to reduce computation time
